# sqlalchemy-challenge

## Purpose
The purpose of this mini project was to use sqlalchemy to obtain weather data from a sqlite database then create a Flask application to create an API with stats such as average temperature and precipitation. Using sqlalchemy I was able to query for stats such as precipitation and temperature. I was also able to filter by various weather stations and dates. Some of these stats were then visualized using plots.
